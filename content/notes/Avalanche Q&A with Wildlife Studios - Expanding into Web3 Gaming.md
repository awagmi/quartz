## Background
[Wildlife Studios](notes/Wildlife%20Studios.md)
- 10 years company based in Brazil
- **2 billion mobile downloads** across apps
- **Top 10** mobile developer

[Castle Crush](notes/Castle%20Crush.md) 
- **Mobile game** with **75mil downloads**, and **over 1.4 million** monthly active users
- Own and upgrade cards


## NFTs in Castle Crush
- [NFT](notes/NFT.md)s will be stronger and cooler looking cards
- Purchase with [$AVAX]($AVAX.md), and also **mint** using [$ACS]($ACS.md)
- [NFT](notes/NFT.md)s **mid april**, playable in june. phased monthly drop
- Hope to convert game community into crypto with [Avalanche](notes/Avalanche.md)
- [Card Games](Card%20Games.md) are a pretty good fit for [NFT](notes/NFT.md)s
- Game balancing 
	- Game mechanics will be on own server (off chain) initially to react quickly
	- [NFT](notes/NFT.md) will be used to focus on ownership
	- Once reach reasonable development cycle then might it be moved to the blockchain


## Thoughts on transitioning from web2 to web3
[@NFT_Silent](notes/@NFT_Silent.md):
- Sentiment is similar to web2 f2p games where people were cautious of f2p games with microtransactions
- Evironmental issues on [Avalanche](notes/Avalanche.md) nonexistent
- [Wildlife Studios](notes/Wildlife%20Studios.md) web2 revenue can be used to fund web3 games 
- No blockchain game has reached critical mass like mobile games yet
	- Their mobile game Sniper3D has close to 500m downloads

[@0xJ010](notes/@0xJ010.md):  
- [Castle Crush](notes/Castle%20Crush.md) community has not manifested any negative sentiment about push to [NFT](notes/NFT.md)s yet
- Most were quite excited about new content to the game
- Anti-nft sentiment mischaracterized, maybe due to uncertaincy in direction

## Tackling a web2 audience
- Most players dont really know how [NFT](notes/NFT.md)s work
- Make it as painless and seamless as possible to use [$AVAX](notes/$AVAX.md)
	- Automatic wallet creation
	- Gasless [Subnet](notes/Subnet.md)

## Why Avalanche?
1. Support from [Ava Labs](Ava%20Labs.md) was great
2. TPS, time to finality of [Avalanche](notes/Avalanche.md)
3. Road map of [Avalanche](notes/Avalanche.md) 
4. Customization of blockchain ([Subnet](notes/Subnet.md))
## Subnet
[Castle Crush Subnet](Castle%20Crush%20Subnet.md) (name not mentioned)
- **gasless** to minimize friction
- marketplace will [$ACS](notes/$ACS.md), [$AVAX](notes/$AVAX.md)
- Automatic wallet creation allowed instantenous earning once they start playing the game

[Validators](Validators.md)
- Initial validators will be the team
	- Process of decentralizing it still in process of being decided

## Metrics to gauge success
- Monthly active users
- [[Lifetime Value]]
- Conversion of current playerbase to the [NFT](notes/NFT.md)s
- Retention - tracking and determining the effect of [NFT](notes/NFT.md)s in game.


## Future Projects
* 2nd web3 project - shooter battle arena 4v4 multiplayer game
	* Focus on production quality
	* **Q2-Q3 2022**
*  3rd web3 project
	* Still developing internally
