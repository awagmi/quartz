## Connecting Avalanche Subnets
[LayerZero](notes/LayerZero.md) on [Avalanche](notes/Avalanche.md) [Subnet](notes/Subnet.md)s
- Most devs use their own bridge for value transfer
- [LayerZero](notes/LayerZero.md) allows for the same game to be played across chains.
- takes away the need to reinvent infrastructure
- [LayerZero](notes/LayerZero.md) will be deploying on all subnets
- Can be used on [NFT](notes/NFT.md)s as well
- Each application can decide what exactly they want to send/receive


## Oracles and relayers
Anyone can be the oracle and relayer
- Not only [Chainlink](notes/Chainlink.md). could be anyone
- both should be different to prevent malicious actions
Limited set of oracles and relayers
- Still in beta
- There will still be popular oracles and relayers, but the goal is to expand
There is no consensus mechanism! Any application can choose any relayer or oracle
- So even if 99% of relayers and oracles are malicious, application can choose the 1%

## Bitcoin and LayerZero
Exploring how to bring [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md) to [LayerZero](notes/LayerZero.md)  
Possible even though [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md) has no [Smart Contracts](notes/Smart%20Contracts.md)
