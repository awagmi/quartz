## Play to earn mindset
- Try to move from [Play2Earn](notes/Play2Earn.md) to Play and earn
- If everyone wants to earn, it obviously isn't sustainable
	- Prime it as having fun and a chance of earning

	- Communities are a huge factor for success

[Fief Guild](notes/Fief%20Guild.md)
 - Figure where we want to pull players into - [Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md) side? or the lore side
 - [Esports](notes/Esports.md) are important as streamers trust the pros - see them as the next step of [GameFi](notes/GameFi.md)


## How do guilds decide what to invest in?

- Tokenomics - **Best tokenomics will appeal to all personality types**
- Presence of a digital nation
- How thought over the target audience, solution end goal etc.
[C2 Ventures](notes/C2%20Ventures.md)
- Not as simple as slapping a token on a project
- Available DAO tooling, [Guild](notes/Guild.md) management
