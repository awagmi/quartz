## Aave V3
[Aave](notes/Aave.md) 
- Capital Efficiency
- Risk and security
- Enhanced decentralization

### Portals
- Cross-chain transactions to flow seamlessly
- Whitelisted bridge protocols to mint and burn a capped amount of tokens
- Governance can whitelist protocols 
### Efficiency Mode
- Capital efficiency
- Increased borrowing power
- For assets highly correlated (AVAX-sAVAX, USDC-DAI). 
- basically higher leverage for very similar assets

### Isolation Mode
- Borrow stables against asset
- sort of like isolated mode in [Binance](notes/Binance.md) futures 
- Manages risk, prevents all your collateral from being liquidated

### Borrow & Supply Caps
- Borrow caps mitigate risks
- Supply caps reduces type of assets that [Aave](notes/Aave.md) can be exposed to

## Admins
- risk, listing admins decided by governance
