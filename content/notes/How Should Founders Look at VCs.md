## On Venture capitalists and founders
- [Venture Capital](notes/Venture%20Capital.md)ist in web2 and web3 not that different
- give guidance, capital which founders needs
- when tech has matured, then it might be different
- naive to believe that web3 companies can mature without expertise of VCs
* founders do want the help
* Difference: hyper competitive
* Founders need to decide if they want the capital or the help

## Having a warchest and help (half rugged)
* communication takes place much openly on twitter


uhh they rugged the livestream 


## Governance Tokens (half rugged)
- Governance tokens sitting on the sidelines
- VCs have a team to decide how to vote

## On talent moving on web2 to web3
[Travis Scher](notes/Travis%20Scher.md)
* Number of A-players entrepreneurs entering the space is insane
* [Jeffrey Amico](notes/Jeffrey%20Amico.md) agrees
* Growth of [Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md) showed the use of intermediary software as a proof of concept


## If you had to pick some things to actively invest in
[Jeffrey Amico](notes/Jeffrey%20Amico.md)
- scaling and enabling new types of applications 

[Peter Najarian](notes/Peter%20Najarian.md)
- regulation coming in a real way (good thing)
- permissioned [Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md)

[Amos Meiri](notes/Amos%20Meiri.md)
- base layer protocols 

[Travis Scher](notes/Travis%20Scher.md)
- digital identity
- defi for real world assets
- Application specific blockchain (doesnt this sound like [Subnet](notes/Subnet.md)s)
