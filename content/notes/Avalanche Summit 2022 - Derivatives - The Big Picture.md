Written on: [21-03-2022](notes/21-03-2022.md)   


[Ribbon Finance](notes/Ribbon%20Finance.md) 
- products that were common in tradfi, but absent in crypto. 
- non-linear (complex) products - mainly options.
- brought options to [Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md) 
- Selling calls/puts - 100mil TVL
- exploring how to use collateral more efficiently
- Focused on decentralization, going multichain
- How decentralized are you?
	- if things goes down, users can always interact with the smart contract (unlike [DyDx](notes/DyDx.md))
- How are you dealing with regulations?
	- Going with the flow, dealing with regulators as they come
	- based in Singapore (for now lol)
- Coming to [Avalanche](notes/Avalanche.md)


[Paradigm](notes/Paradigm.md)
- solving liquidity for institutions - institutions are looking for trade more complicated structures
- Single point of access for institutions for multiple institutions
- Sees themselves as the bridge between centralized entities and [Decentralized Exchange](notes/Decentralized%20Exchange.md)s

[Genesis Trading](notes/Genesis%20Trading.md)
- Generally already heavily regulated
- Capital efficiency between [Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md) and exchanges needs to be improved on
	- Some ideas - [NFT](notes/NFT.md)s to represent funds 

[Automated Market Maker](notes/Automated%20Market%20Maker.md)
- Linear product (implying less complex)
- one of the biggest innovations in [Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md)
- dependent on arbitrageurs to maintain market price across AMMs
- not scalable because of collateral, margin management
- market makers take on risk off chain, makes it more scalable
- difficult to price options using AMMs on chain


[Options](notes/Options.md) in [Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md)
- has already grown to 1 billion TVL
- [Darius Sit](notes/Darius%20Sit.md): [Options](notes/Options.md) are more familiar to banks, tradfi, regulators so they are more inclined to know about them as (compared to [Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md))
	- thinks its the way for institutions to enter [Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md)

[Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md)
- [Darius Sit](notes/Darius%20Sit.md)
	- good way for [Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md) to expand is to use yields from outside (ie non crypto?)
	- trend of more people having a larger % of their networth in metamask as compared to banks
- [Paradigm](notes/Paradigm.md)
	- Crypto space has already been proactive about regulations, but still remains a huge vulnerability
