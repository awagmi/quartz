## Current Problems with the NFT Landscape
- There is a right way to launch [NFT](notes/NFT.md)s
- Mistakes result in lost value

Some exchanges take your [NFT](notes/NFT.md) and put it in their contract. Some just ask for permissions

## Stuff to watch out for
* [IPFS](notes/IPFS.md), [Arweave](notes/Arweave.md), [Filecoin](notes/Filecoin.md) - decentralized storage
	*  Can be expensive to set up
	* File capacity makes it very hard to have large graphics
		* Hence pixelated graphics were popular
	* JSON should always be open and readable
* Doxxed creators is good
* Understand both the technical and development perspective
* https://checkmynft.com to give you an overview of the strength of the asset (only on [Ethereum](notes/Ethereum.md) for now)

## Storing Metadata
Most decentralized way
- On chain metadata
- No singular owner can change the metadata
	- If owner can change metadata as and when they like, its not that decentralized 
- Limit deployer control without compromising integrity of the project

## Minting an NFT without tech experience
Avoid
- Deploying to shared contracts
- 'Lazy' minting
- Centralized storage
- Lack of custody
Listing on an off-chain marketplace
- Users should have maximum custody possible over their assets

## NFTrade Solution
[NFTrade](notes/NFTrade.md)
- Drag and drop
- The creator will have the sole control
- Batch minting
- Some tutorial on how to mint shown the video, seems to be on [Ethereum](notes/Ethereum.md)
