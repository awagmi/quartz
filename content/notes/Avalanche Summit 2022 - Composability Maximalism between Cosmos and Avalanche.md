## Commonalities between Cosmos and Avalanche
[Cosmos](notes/Cosmos.md) and [Avalanche](notes/Avalanche.md)
- Shared goals - ecosystem of blockchain
[Cosmos](notes/Cosmos.md) - Transport, Authentication, and Ordering (TAO)
- Authentication needs to be customized for [Subnet](notes/Subnet.md)

## Sealing Subnets
- [Avalanche](notes/Avalanche.md) is a polling based protocol
- [Tendermint BFT](notes/Tendermint%20BFT.md) is a voting based protocol
	- [Subnet](notes/Subnet.md)s could vote from time to time using [Tendermint BFT](notes/Tendermint%20BFT.md)
- Sealing is the idea of having subnets vote in their VMs on elements of their state.
	- Basically a [Tendermint BFT](notes/Tendermint%20BFT.md) [Subnet](notes/Subnet.md)?
## Things excited about Zaki is excited about
- Unique properties about [Subnet](notes/Subnet.md)s
	- Subsecond finality
	- specific usecases for developers
- Fuse of both [Tendermint BFT](notes/Tendermint%20BFT.md) and [Subnet](notes/Subnet.md)
