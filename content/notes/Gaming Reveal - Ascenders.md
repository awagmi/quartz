* battle looks quite basic - hack and slash, limited or no skills
* Different terrains - snow, forests?
* different forms of enemies - so far only seems to be the same humanoid cyborgy shape
* Items seems to be autoloot
* Limited time to explore to either gain points based on kills, items collected
