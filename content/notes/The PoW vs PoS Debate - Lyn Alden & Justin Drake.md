## Introduction of Guests
[Justin Drake](notes/Justin%20Drake.md)
- Helping [Ethereum](notes/Ethereum.md) transit to [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md)

[Lyn Alden](notes/Lyn%20Alden.md)
- Macro expert
- Proponent of [Proof of Work](notes/Proof%20of%20Work.md)
- Critical of [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md)

## Which Consensus Mechanism has better Accrual of Monetary Premium 

[Lyn Alden](notes/Lyn%20Alden.md)
- [Proof of Work](notes/Proof%20of%20Work.md) have to be constantly online, while [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md) as
- [Proof of Work](notes/Proof%20of%20Work.md) harder to attack - needs the physical hardware
- Money should be the simplest, leanest, no bloat. something that’s tries to be everything is not good money 
 

## Equities vs Commodities
[Justin Drake](notes/Justin%20Drake.md)
- Should also apply the same (equity) analogy to [Proof of Work](notes/Proof%20of%20Work.md)
- [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md) has a social layer, stakers are beholden to community members
- Argues that we should make an apples to apples comparison. ie compare [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md) [Proof of Work](notes/Proof%20of%20Work.md) vs [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md) / [Ethereum](notes/Ethereum.md) [Proof of Work](notes/Proof%20of%20Work.md) vs [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md)
- [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md) can simply remove a malicious validator from the validator set in the case of any attack (forced exit)

[Lyn Alden](notes/Lyn%20Alden.md)
- [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md) similar to shareholders of a company (bound by law)
- Agrees there’s granularity to it - but stresses it’s easier to become equity, harder to become commodities (because immutable)
- [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md) situation can become centralized when a majority capital holder can lockdown/censor the network
- If [Proof of Work](notes/Proof%20of%20Work.md) gets banned, they can just migrate the hash power somewhere else. But for [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md), whales, custodians can determine the fate of the network
	- [Justin Drake](notes/Justin%20Drake.md) argues that it is fundamentally still a function of capital - ie if u have enough capital, u can take control of the network ([51% attack](notes/51%25%20attack.md)). [Genesis Mining](notes/Genesis%20Mining.md) are also custodians of the hash rate, they rent hash rate out. 
		- [Lyn Alden](notes/Lyn%20Alden.md) argues that smaller entities actually have the advantage
- [Federal Reserve](notes/Federal%20Reserve.md) is an example of [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md) system not on a blockchain. [Proof of Work](notes/Proof%20of%20Work.md) brought back digital commodities

## Complexity and bugs
[Justin Drake](notes/Justin%20Drake.md)
- [Ethereum](notes/Ethereum.md) is admittedly 10x or even 100x more complex than [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md)
- Humanity is great at abstracting away complexity
- Client diversity to mitigate the risks of bugs and complexity of [Ethereum](notes/Ethereum.md)
	- [Lyn Alden](notes/Lyn%20Alden.md) agrees, but reiterates that having the leanest code is still the best way to prevent bugs
- Argues that [Bitcoin Core](notes/Bitcoin%20Core.md) relies on the security of many external factors - operating system, supply chain to provide the correct code/data


## Being a last mover in Bitcoin
[Lyn Alden](notes/Lyn%20Alden.md)
- Last mover/miner in [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md) is a lot more advantaged
[Justin Drake](notes/Justin%20Drake.md)
- Argues its actually a huge disadvantage
- Hardware for mining would be extremely expensive
- [Moore's Law](notes/Moore's%20Law.md) also makes it easier for would be attackers. Cost of making the attack is the hardware, not the actual operating costs

## Centralization and Participation
[Justin Drake](notes/Justin%20Drake.md)
- After a decade in the space, does not know any individual who operates [Proof of Work](notes/Proof%20of%20Work.md), it's all industrial.
- [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md) has contributions from everyone and much more accessible to everyone 
[Lyn Alden](notes/Lyn%20Alden.md)
- There are tiny private firms mining [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md), but still bigger than individual, but still tiny in the global scale
- There is not one model for [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md) miners

## Jack of all trades, master of none

[Lyn Alden](notes/Lyn%20Alden.md)
- The more a system tries to do many things, the worse it performs at these things
- When [Ethereum](notes/Ethereum.md) tried to harden its monetary policy, it started losing market share in [Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md) to other ecosystems


## Subjective vs Objective reasons for Bitcoin
The question posed: How much do people of the world like the [Proof of Work](notes/Proof%20of%20Work.md) system more because it feels more fair (subjective) and how much like the technical workings of [Proof of Work](notes/Proof%20of%20Work.md) (objective)   
[Lyn Alden](notes/Lyn%20Alden.md)
- Depends who u talk to
- personally approaches it more from a technical risk perspective
- The closer an entity is to the money printer, the easier it is to get financed

## Aspects of Governance?
[Lyn Alden](notes/Lyn%20Alden.md)
- Being able to have a say in which transaction passes/which doesn't
	- Counter question by [David Hoffman](notes/David%20Hoffman.md): Aren't the mining rigs/hardware the governance model for [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md), just like how [$ETH](notes/$ETH.md) is the governance asset for [Ethereum](notes/Ethereum.md)?
		- [Lyn Alden](notes/Lyn%20Alden.md): [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md) system can lead to wealth concentration, early holders effectively have a permanent stake in the system. Whereas for [Proof of Work](notes/Proof%20of%20Work.md) it depends on the miners having to continuously ensure their hardware is competitive 
- Also being to influence the protocol itself
	- [Proof of Work](notes/Proof%20of%20Work.md) comparison to gold producers - gold producers have no control over the price of gold 

## Closing Argument: What is the best way to create crypto money?
[Justin Drake](notes/Justin%20Drake.md)
- Asset needs a Schelling point for it to have monetary premium
- There is much more money to maintain economic security for [Ethereum](notes/Ethereum.md) compared to [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md)
- [Proof of Stake](notes/Proof%20of%20Stake.md) stands out in both quantitative and qualitative standpoint  

[Lyn Alden](notes/Lyn%20Alden.md)
- We want things that are the hardest, most immutable to be money
- We want things that are held for monetary premium (like gold), not for utility (compared to oil which is used for utility)
- We want things that are the simplest, so it minimizes bugs
	- us nuclear code in floppy disks
	- security systems are usually slow to update to the latest tech
	- we want it to work when we want it to work, not work when we dont want it to work
