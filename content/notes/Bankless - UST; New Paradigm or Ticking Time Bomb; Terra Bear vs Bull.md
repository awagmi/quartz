[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md) is a [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) bull  
[Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md) is a [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) bear  
## Fundamental Properties
[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md)
- draws an analogy to [$DAI](notes/$DAI.md) except that [Terra](notes/Terra.md) is a [Layer 1](notes/Layer%201.md) blockchain
- [$DAI](notes/$DAI.md) is a debt based stablecoin
- Gives [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) unlimited value captures from its growth of [$UST](notes/$UST.md)
- About to be the most liquid with [4pool](notes/4pool.md) on [Curve](notes/Curve.md)
- [$UST](notes/$UST.md) and [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) are protocol native tokens of [Terra](notes/Terra.md)
- Arbitrage opportunities helps [$UST](notes/$UST.md) to retain its peg
[Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md)
- [$UST](notes/$UST.md) is collaterized by the value of the underlying chain while [$DAI](notes/$DAI.md) is over collaterized
- Can lead to a death spiral when everyone wants to exit at the same time

### Comparison with other algostables
[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md)
- Unfair comparison to compare [$UST](notes/$UST.md) with other failed algostables as they never maintained stability

### Monetary schedule
[Ryan Sean Adams](notes/Ryan%20Sean%20Adams.md)
- There is no fixed monetary schedule for [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md)
- [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) can be minted/burned in response to the value of [$UST](notes/$UST.md)

## Why are you bullish/bearish?
[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md) (bullish)
- [Disclaimer](notes/Disclaimer.md): most of his networth in luna, but don't think its riskless, and doesn't think he's a maxi
- Stablecoins are crypto killer apps.
- Centralized stablecoins will eventually be regulated away
- [$UST](notes/$UST.md) is growing the fastest, is already the largest [Algostable](notes/Algostable.md) by marketcap while [$DAI](notes/$DAI.md) is actually declining
[Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md) (bearish)
- [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md): Doesn't hope [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) to fail, no positions on [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md), but has money in anchor
- Thinks [Anchor Protocol](notes/Anchor%20Protocol.md) is currently an unsustainable marketing spend 
- [$DAI](notes/$DAI.md) is overcollaterized - leads to extreme capital ineffiency 
- [$UST](notes/$UST.md) is uncollaterized - can lead to too fast a growth
- Even if [$UST](notes/$UST.md) doesnt depeg, other protocols can mimic [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) protocols which can lead to the price of [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) dropping

## What makes UST successful?
[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md)
- [Algostable](notes/Algostable.md) are more of a demand problem compared to a mechanism design problem
- Money is used for spending, or deferred spending. Ecosystem around [$UST](notes/$UST.md): [Mirror](notes/Mirror.md) - Synthetic Assets, [Mars Protocol](notes/Mars%20Protocol.md) - Credit protocol, and so on
- Important for [Algostable](notes/Algostable.md)s to have utility, as seen from [Fei Protocol](notes/Fei%20Protocol.md) and [Rari Capital](notes/Rari%20Capital.md) merger
[Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md)
- [Anchor Protocol](notes/Anchor%20Protocol.md) 20% APY is sort of a ponzi incentive to get people onto [Terra](notes/Terra.md)
- [Chai](notes/Chai.md), a way to spend [$UST](notes/$UST.md) in real life, was a good experiment but didnt work out well
- Lots of big players backing [Terra](notes/Terra.md)
	- [Do Kwon](notes/Do%20Kwon.md) with great execution spirit
	- [Jump Trading](notes/Jump%20Trading.md)
- Not sure if [$UST](notes/$UST.md) will depeg, but there are definitely risks that can lead to a death spiral 

### Are we building a utility layer on an unstable foundation?
[David Hoffman](notes/David%20Hoffman.md): Are we obfuscating the instability of [Algostable](notes/Algostable.md)s with a utility layer?  
[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md) answer:
- Not that  [Algostable](notes/Algostable.md)s are inherently unstable, but most [Algostable](notes/Algostable.md)s are too focused on ponzinomics

## Anchor Protocol
[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md)
- What is the premium that people will take to accept the risk in [$UST](notes/$UST.md)?
- 20% is unsustainable, agrees with [Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md) that its marketing spend, doesn't think it about attracting retail
- 7-12% real yield without yield reserve
	- Best place to borrow and lend [Layer 1](notes/Layer%201.md) assets
	- Also depends on [$ANC](notes/$ANC.md) token incentives and price
[Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md)
- [Anchor Protocol](notes/Anchor%20Protocol.md) 20% APY is sort of a ponzi incentive to get people onto [Terra](notes/Terra.md)
	- 20% APY is being propped up by [Luna Foundation Guard](notes/Luna%20Foundation%20Guard.md) from [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) in the treasury and propping up the interest rates to keep it at 20%.
	- Marketing spend to bring retail onto [Terra](notes/Terra.md) is a good idea, but did not play out as intended because of applications like [Degenbox](notes/Degenbox.md) which takes advantage of the 20% yield. 

## Bitcoin purchases by LFG
[Ryan Sean Adams](notes/Ryan%20Sean%20Adams.md): Are the [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md) purchases by [Luna Foundation Guard](notes/Luna%20Foundation%20Guard.md) an admission that the model does not work?  
[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md)
- Hard to deny that the model does not work
- To move to the next stage of trust and adoption, [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md) is required to scale further
- Growth of the model, rather than an admission 
[Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md)
- Pretty universally agreed that having [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md) as collateral is a good move

### Who custodies this Bitcoin
[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md)
- [Disclosure](notes/Disclosure.md): he is one of the 7 directors of [Luna Foundation Guard](notes/Luna%20Foundation%20Guard.md)
- Currently the [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md) is custodied by the [Luna Foundation Guard](notes/Luna%20Foundation%20Guard.md).
	- Not the best scenario, will be moved to a trustless decentralized process 

## Risks of depegs
[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md)
- Important to concede that there are risks
- [$DAI](notes/$DAI.md) prioritizes safety and protection from tail risk while [$UST](notes/$UST.md) prioritizes growth and capital efficiency over downside risk
- [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md) reserves breaks that reflexivity death spiral
	- Is 3 billion enough? No one knows
	- Psychological impact is huge
- [Lindy Effect](notes/Lindy%20Effect.md) and network effects can help [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) prolong its lifespan
[Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md)
- Reduction in [$UST](notes/$UST.md) demand because of decrease of [Anchor Protocol](notes/Anchor%20Protocol.md) yields
	- [Terra](notes/Terra.md) is buying time for [$UST](notes/$UST.md) to get wider adoption outside of [$UST](notes/$UST.md)
- Nothing stopping other already successful [Layer 1](notes/Layer%201.md) to get a native [Algostable](notes/Algostable.md)
	- [José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md) rebuts that there is still that same problem to generating demand for that [Algostable](notes/Algostable.md)
### Has UST been tested?
[Ryan Sean Adams](notes/Ryan%20Sean%20Adams.md): Stablecoins must hold its peg not just in bull runs, but also in bear markets  
[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md)
- May 2021 was quite a testing time for [$UST](notes/$UST.md). [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) had a price drop along with some coordinated fud
	- when there was a death spiral ongoing, deposits on [Anchor Protocol](notes/Anchor%20Protocol.md) actually increased
		- [Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md) rebuts that it's just intra community capital movement, does not indicate faith by the broader market
	- Both [Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md) and [José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md) agree reduction of [Anchor Protocol](notes/Anchor%20Protocol.md) rates will be a test like none other
- Thinks there will be other tests, but [$UST](notes/$UST.md) has been battle tested

## Decentralization and Do Kwon
[Ryan Sean Adams](notes/Ryan%20Sean%20Adams.md): [Do Kwon](notes/Do%20Kwon.md) as a key man risk  
[Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md)
- Personally does not want to focus on this, doesn't think it is big deal
- Thinks that powerful backers kind of kickstarted [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) growth inorganically
- 2 main big group building lots of primitives - mixed feelings
[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md)
- Believes in progressive decentralization
- Stablecoins require good execution to push integrations, usage
- Thinks [Terra](notes/Terra.md) is doing it right


## 4Pool - UST-FRAX-USDC-USDT
[4pool](notes/4pool.md) UST-FRAX-USDC-USDT  
[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md)
- Partnership with [Frax Finance](notes/Frax%20Finance.md) to make it the most liquid pool in [Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md)
- Being the most liquid is a huge win - not a direct threat to a [$DAI](notes/$DAI.md)
- Not enough to just maintain the peg, the stablecoin must grow, which is what [$DAI](notes/$DAI.md) is not doing
[Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md)
- Experimental land, interested to see how it plays out
- Not sure on [$DAI](notes/$DAI.md) prospects
- Don't think [$USDC](notes/$USDC.md) will be affected in a significant way

## Nightmare scenario (tail risk events)
[Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md)
- Big players can monopolize the daily redeeming cap of the Bitcoin reserve, leaving little or none for retail
	- [Joseph Khan](notes/Joseph%20Khan.md) - whales do have to suffer slippage
- Curve pool can be wiped 

## Closing Arguments
[Jordi Alexander](notes/Jordi%20Alexander.md) (bear)
- [$UST](notes/$UST.md) depeg
- [Layer 1](notes/Layer%201.md) replicates the same mechanism
- Be aware that big funds are pulling strings
- Too many variables to get to the conclusion that [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) will succeed 
[José Maria Macedo](notes/José%20Maria%20Macedo.md)
- How misunderstood [$Luna](notes/$Luna.md) it still is 
- Upside is huge for [$UST](notes/$UST.md) as the biggest decentralized stablecoin
- Model is becoming more and more resilient with [Bitcoin](notes/Bitcoin.md) reserve
- More and more smart builders are building on [Terra](notes/Terra.md)
