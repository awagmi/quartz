## Where are we in the Defi landscape
* 400T marketcap out there. Blockchain has 4T (1%) - great, not the end, but not beginning either.
	* [John Nahas](notes/John%20Nahas.md): end of the beginning. Still a much greater pie out there
* Hard to create value in spaces not yet explored

## What barriers?
- [Decentralized Finance](notes/Decentralized%20Finance.md) relevant, but not major. Not used by billions yet
- User experience biggest barrier. People want a one click experience
	- For the average person, using metamask is a high barrier of entry
- Think about what and who products are building for. And why will they want to use it?

## Where will incumbents move into the space
* There is a realization that blockchain is super useful
* Banks are researching how to use blockchain for better value creation for their customers

## Does blockchain need to be known? or the app
- Blockchains benefits need to be known - secure, safe, robust
- Blockchains will signify trust. Blockchain == Trust
