Customization of blockchain ([Subnet](notes/Subnet.md))\n## Subnet\n[Castle Crush Subnet](Castle%20Crush%20Subnet.md) (name not mentioned)\n- **gasless** to minimize friction\n- marketplace will use [$ACS](notes/$ACS.md), [$AVAX](notes/$AVAX.md)\n- Automatic wallet creation allowed instantaneous earning once they start playing the game\n\n[Validators](Validators.md)\n- Initial validators will be the team\n\t- Process of decentralizing it still in process of being decided\n\n## Metrics to gauge success\n- Monthly active users\n- [Lifetime Value](Lifetime%20Value.md)\n- Conversion of current player base to the [NFT](notes/NFT.md)s\n- Retention - tracking and determining the effect of [NFT](notes/NFT.md)s in game.\n\n\n## Future Projects\n* 2nd web3 project - shooter battle arena 4v4 multiplayer game\n\t* Focus on production quality\n\t* **Q2-Q3 2022**\n*  3rd web3 project\n\t* Still developing internally","lastmodified":"2022-03-24T17:14:30.590452281Z","tags":null},"/notes/Avalanche-QnA-with-Chikn-Farmland-and-the-New-Era-of-NFTs":{"title":"Avalanche QnA with Chikn -

[Bryan Pellegrino](notes/Bryan%20Pellegrino.md), [Caleb Banister](notes/Caleb%20Banister.md)  \nSubmitted on: [26-05-2021](notes/26-05-2021.md)  \nWritten on: [16-03-2022](notes/16-03-2022.md)  \nURL: https://layerzero.network/pdf/LayerZero_Whitepaper_Release.pdf  \n\nThis is a summary of the whitepaper in the URL above. \n\n## TLDR\n[LayerZero](notes/LayerZero.md) - a Trustless Omnichain interoperability protocol  \n- Allows 2 separate blockchains to communicate using 2 independent components\n\t- Basically, you get these two independent components to make sure the transactions are valid from the sender before the receiver decides to anything\n- General communication layer, NOT a blockchain\n- Touts benefits of being less complex, less overheads, and being able to extend to any blockchain without being hindered by its native SDK.\n\n## Introduction\nCore pillars of blockchain - [Decentralization](notes/Decentralization.md), [Transparency](notes/Transparency.md), [Immutability](notes/Immutability.md)\n### Problem\nLiquidity/developers/users are walled within an blockchain\n![](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020220317231855.png)\nBandaid measures:\n1. use of centralized services (such as [Binance](notes/Binance.md))\n\t- Does not align with [Trustlessness](notes/Trustlessness.md) of blockchain\n2. use of [Cross Chain Bridge](notes/Cross%20Chain%20Bridge.md)s such as [AnySwap](notes/AnySwap.md) or [THORChain](notes/THORChain.md)\n\t- Relies on protocol specific intermediate tokens or intermediate consensus layers\n\n### Solution\n[LayerZero](notes/LayerZero.md), a **communication primitive**, allows transactions between multiple blockchain using\n- allows transactions between multiple [Layer 1](notes/Layer%201.md) or [Layer 2](notes/Layer%202.md) chains.\n- Intuition: if two independent entities can corroborate the validity of a transaction, then Chain B can be sure the transaction from Chain A is valid\n\n\n## Related Work\n1. [Ethereum](notes/Ethereum.md) - original [Ethereum Virtual Machine](notes/Ethereum%20Virtual%20Machine.md) chain, but low 15-45tps makes it hard to scale  \n[Polygon](notes/Polygon.md) - [Layer 2](notes/Layer%202.md) [Sidechain](notes/Sidechain.md)  \n2. [PolkaDot](notes/PolkaDot.md) - [Parachains](notes/Parachains.md) are interlinked via a common relay chain. However there is additional cost when using this relay chain  \n3. [THORChain](notes/THORChain.md) - Uses pairwise liquidity pools to bind 3rd party currency to [$RUNE](notes/$RUNE.md). While authors acknowledge it solves  the scalability problem, it is cumbersome to use as a simple transaction can be quite complicated  \n4. [AnySwap](notes/AnySwap.md) - [Decentralized Exchange](notes/Decentralized%20Exchange.md) which relies on intermediate token [$ANY](notes/$ANY.md) , similar to [THORChain](notes/THORChain.md). Similar issues too\n5. [Cosmos](notes/Cosmos.md) - [Inter-Blockchain Communication](notes/Inter-Blockchain%20Communication.md) built on [Tendermint BFT](notes/Tendermint%20BFT.md) which allows messaging between chains built on the hub  \n\t- [Inter-Blockchain Communication](notes/Inter-Blockchain%20Communication.md) requires a full on chain [Light node](notes/Light%20node.md) of each chain  \n\t- Only provides direct communication between fast finality chains  \n\t- [Gravity Bridge](notes/Gravity%20Bridge.md) - [AnySwap](notes/AnySwap.md) and [Cosmos](notes/Cosmos.md) equivalent   \n6. [Chainlink](notes/Chainlink.md) - Framework for building   \n\n## How does LayerZero Work?\nCommunication protocol which provides trustless [Valid Delivery](notes/Valid%20Delivery.md)\n### Components\n#### Endpoints\n[Smart Contracts](notes/Smart%20Contracts.md) which implement 4 modules which basically share information with each other:\n1. Communicator\n2. Validator\n3. Network\n4. Libraries - each new chain is an added library\n1 Endpoint for each chain.\n#### Oracle\nCan be any oracle to read a block from one chain and send to another  \nExpected to be [Chainlink](notes/Chainlink.md) as industry leader\n\n#### Relayer\nOff-chain service that fetches proof for a specific transaction\n- similar to oracle but for proof of transaction)\n\n### Steps\n![](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020220317234427.png)\n**Simplified Version with less jargon**   \n1. Person A on Chain A wants to send a *`message`* to Chain B using an application. Application tells the Communicator A relevant details about where the *`message`* wants to go\n2. Communicator A tells Validator A that there is a *`message`* to be validated\n3. (step 3 and 4 happen concurrently) Validator A tells Network A that the **block header H** needs to be sent to Chain B\n4. (step 3 and 4 happen concurrently) Validator A tells Relayer A that he needs the proof that the *`message`* on Chain A has been sent. \n5. Network A tells Oracle to send current **block header H** of Chain A to Chain B\n6. (step 6 and 7 happen asynchronously) Oracle gets current **block header H** from Chain A\n7. (step 6 and 7 happen asynchronously) Relayer gets the *message transaction proof* of the *`message`* from Chain A, and stores it off-chain\n8. Oracle confirms that the block referred to by **block header H** is finalized, then sends H to Chain B\n9. Network B receives the block header hash, and gives it to Validator B\n10. Validator B sends the hash to Relayer B\n11. Relayer B sends the *`message`* and *message transaction proof* to Validator B\n12. Validator B gets both the *`message`* and *message transaction proof*, and checks if the *proof* and the **block header H** it received in step 9 matches. If yes, send *`message`* to communicator.\n13. Communicator will send *`message`* to App B.\n\n\n## Application\n1. [Cross Chain Bridge](notes/Cross%20Chain%20Bridge.md)  \n2. [Multi-Chain](notes/Multi-Chain.md) [Yield Aggregator](notes/Yield%20Aggregator.md)  \n3.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml\nname: Your name here! # Shows in the footer\nenableToc: true # Whether to show a Table of Contents\nenableLinkPreview: true # whether to render card previews for links\ndescription: Page description to show to search engines\npage_title: Quartz Example Page # Default Page Title\n\nlinks: # Links to show in footer\n  - link_name: Twitter\n    link: https://twitter.com/_jzhao\n  - link_name: Github\n    link: https://github.com/jackyzha0\n```\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml\nenableLegend: false # automatically generate a legend\nenableDrag: true # allow dragging nodes in the graph\nenableZoom: true # allow zooming and panning the graph\ndepth: -1 # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\npaths: # colour specific nodes path off of their path\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what actually gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Multilingual\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```","lastmodified":"2022-03-24T17:14:30.59445232Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n🔗 [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n### Ignoring Files\nOnly want to publish a subset of all of your notes? Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.\n\n❌ [Excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md)\n\n### Folder Structure\nHere's a rough overview of what's what.\n\n**All content in your garden can found in the `/content` folder.** To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.*\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files.

Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub.

Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`.\n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`.\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.","lastmodified":"2022-03-24T17:14:30.64245279Z","tags":null},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"If you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, here's exactly how to do that!\n\nNote that both of these steps need to be completed.\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```shell\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\n$ go install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\n$ cd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Scrape all links in your Quartz folder and generate info for Quartz\n$ hugo-obsidian -input=content -output=assets/indices -index -root=.\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\n$ cd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\n$ hugo server\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```","lastmodified":"2022-03-24T17:14:30.64245279Z","tags":null},"/notes/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### Do I need a website already?\nNo! Setting up Quartz means you set up a site too :)\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder. The only caveat is that you should reference them in your Markdown by prefixing it with a `/`.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.yaml` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-03-24T17:14:30.64245279Z","tags":null}}
